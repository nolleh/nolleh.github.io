      <description>Linux Philosophy Overview Linux is constantly enhanced and maintained by a network of developers from all over the world collaborating over the internet, with Linus Torvalds at the head.
Linux Philosophy Linux borrows heavily from the well-established UNIX operating system. it was written to be a free and open source system to be used in place of UNIX,
which at the time was designed for computers much more powerful than PCs and was quite expensive.</description>

      <description>다음에서 발췌, 번역
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/windows/desktop/cc644950(v=vs.85).aspx File Buffering 파일버퍼링 - unbuffered file I/O.
본문에선 시스템에 의해 캐싱되지 않는 (buffered) 데이터를
어떻게 유저 모드의 응용프로그램에서 데이터를 활용할 수 (interact) 있을지에 대해 다룬다.
FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING 플래그를 통해 CreateFile 을 Open 하면,
파일을 읽거나 쓸때 시스템의 캐싱을 비활성화 하도록 제어할 수 있다.
I/O 버퍼링을 사용한것과 같은 효과를 내려면, 데이터 alignment 가 반드시 고려되어야 한다.
Note 파일에 대해 Seeking 과 위치포인터, offsets 의 개념을 사용하는 파일에 대해 alignment 정보가 고려될 필요가 있다.</description>
