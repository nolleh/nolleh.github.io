      <description>The Boot Process The Linux boot process is the procedure for initializing the system.
from when the computer power is first swithced on until the user interface is fully operational.
having a good understanding of the steps in the boot process may help you with troubleshooting problems, as well as with tailoring the computer&amp;rsquo;s performance to your needs.
On the other hand, the boot process can be rather technical, and you can start using Linux without knowing all the details.</description>

      <description>Chapter Summary Linux boroows heavily from UNIX operating system, with withch its creators were well-versed. LInux accesses many features and services through files and file-like objects. Linux is a fully multi-tasking, multi-user operating system, with built-in networking and service processes known as deamons. Linux is developed by a loose confederation of developers from all over the world, collaborating over the Internet,
with Linus Torvalds at th head. Technical sill and a desire to contriubte are the only qualifications for participating.</description>

Linux Philosophy Linux borrows heavily from the well-established UNIX operating system. it was written to be a free and open source system to be used in place of UNIX,
which at the time was designed for computers much more powerful than PCs and was quite expensive.</description>

Linux History Linus Torvalds was a student in Helsinki, Finland, in 1991, when he started a project: writing his own operating system kernal. collected together and/or developed the other essential ingredients required to construct an entire operating system with his kernel at the center.

      <title>Mac 터미널에서 복수의 유저 사용하기</title>

      <description>복수의 유저 사용하기 맥터미널에서 복수의 유저를 사용하려면 몇가지 신경써야할 부분들이 생긴다.
home directory 가 분리 되어 있기 때문에 어떤 유저를 위해 설치한 데이터들은
다른 유저에서는 사용못할수도 있고 (그러는게 맞고, 그럴려고 격리한거니)
그러다보니 양쪽에서 같은 데이터를 설치해야하나 ?
혹은 서로 충돌이 난다거나 하는 불편함들이 생긴다.
대표적인 예로 brew 에서 이런 문제가 발생하는데,,
어떤 계정으로 설치한 패키지가 다른 계정에서 권한문제로 접근이 안되게 되면서 엉망이 된다.. (-_&amp;ndash;) dependency 가 있는 다른 패키지 들과도 맞물리게 되면서 내가 설치한 패키지가 아닌 패키지에 대해 데이터를 바꾸려고 하면서 권한 이슈로 연결 되는식.</description>
